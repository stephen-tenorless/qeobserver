    "How active materials and quantum randomness can keep critical systems in one piece.",

    "When a hairline fracture in the hall’s decorative glass softened mid-keynote, the safety logs stayed clear—no collider, no actuator, just a quiet intent vector. Anchor Matter is the receiving half of that story. Materials seeded with qE lattice sites become slightly more likely to adopt the state the observer is calmly watching for: a crack holding instead of spreading, a bridge cable settling instead of snapping.",
    "The process isn’t brute force. Anchor Matter rides the same quantum randomness that forms micro-fractures in the first place, adding a tiny bias toward structural integrity. The Pebble listens for the wearer’s calm attention, encodes that direction into entangled photons, and the paired Anchor sites feel a probabilistic lean toward repair.",
    "For infrastructure, that means distributed self-healing without heavy machinery: materials that notice stress, respond to human oversight, and quietly reinforce themselves before failure cascades. It’s preventive maintenance embedded in the matter itself.",
