  summary: "What ‘self-consistent’ really means when you're pushing on causality.",
  content: [
    "The keynote framed our drive channel as ‘pushing here, it moves there.’ That line lands because the entangled photons inside each Pebble maintain correlations regardless of distance: a meter or a million kilometers doesn’t change the link quality. What keeps that from becoming a time machine is self-consistency. We’re not sending classical bits faster than light; we’re steering probability within the allowed envelope.",
    "Every entanglement request is paired with local verification. The calm channel locks the interface unless the wearer’s vitals signal steadiness, so intent arrives as a low-noise vector instead of a scrambled shout. When the paired lattice feels that vector, it nudges outcomes toward the observed state—but only within margins that won’t violate causality. You get faster-than-light correlation, not faster-than-light signaling.",
    "That’s why Stephen could demonstrate long-haul responsiveness on stage without collapsing the keynote into paradoxes. We ride quantum nonlocality to deliver coherence, then let classical physics enforce the limits.",
